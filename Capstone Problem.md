# Recommendation of London Boroughs

## Introduction

A very common problem for a lot of people is choosing where to live in a big city. While rent is an important factor when deciding which area to live in, there are a lot of other subjective criteria based on personal preferrences - e.g. what kind of venues would one like to have close to home (shopping, bars, parks, etc.), are there parks nearby, etc. There are various solutions to this problem - online search, asking friends, visiting the areas yourself - all of these are rather time consuming and subjective. However, this problem can be tackled using a data-driven approach by  creating a recommendation engine that would suggest areas that match the user-defined criteria.

London, UK is one of the largest cities in the world and contains 33 areas (also known as boroughs). This presents a good use case for implementing such an algorithm and testing whether it makes sensible recommendations.
